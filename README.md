# {the jump} - WEATHER API PROJECT

## Brief

Make a website using APIs and vanilla JS.
Done for <i>the jump digital</i>'s full-stack course.

### Description

The goal of the project was to practice both vanilla JavaScript and using APIs to retrieve data.

#### I chose to use the following APIs:

1. Visual Crossing's Timeline Weather API: this allowed me to retrieve both current and historical weather data at the same time, as well as a 15-day forecast for free.

2. OpenWeatherMap's Geocoding API: this allowed me to retrieve latitude and longitude coordinates from user-inputted geolocation coordinates.

## Things to improve

- Styling: As the task was mainly about the JavaScript and API use, the styling is basic. I plan to return to and improve this in the future, to make the website look less like it was made in the 90s.
- Layout: The layout is basic and I would like to improve this and make it more consistent and responsive.
- CSS to SCSS: I plan to refactor the CSS to SCSS to increase efficiency and reduce file size.
